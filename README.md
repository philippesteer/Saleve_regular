# Saleve_regular
An analytical model to solve for 2D landscape evolution using the stream power law - regular grid

To use these Matlab routines, you need to download Topotoolbox (https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/) and put in a folder named "topotoolbox-master" at the same level than these matlab routines.

Slower version of these models, using an irregular grid, are available here: https://github.com/philippesteer/Saleve
